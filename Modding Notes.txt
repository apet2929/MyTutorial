How to make block, step by step
1) Create block class inside creatorname/modname/blocks
2) Register block in the mod class (com/creatorname/modname/modname.java) with a block and an item
3) Instantiate a static block variable in the ModBlocks class (com/creatorname/modname/blocks/ModBlocks.java)

Now, here you can already access your block. Try it!

4) Create a blockstates .json for the block named block registry name (resources/assets/modname/blockstates)
5) Create another .json for the block named block unlocalized name (resources/assets/modname/models/block)
6) Create a third and final .json for the block named block name (resources/assets/modname/models/item)
7) Put the texture for the block in (resources/assets/modname/textures/block)

Now the block should have a texture. Test again.

8) Make a loot table so that it drops when destroyed (resources/data/modname/loot_tables/blocks)
9) Set the displayed name in the language file (assets/modname/lang)
10) Set the item recipe (resources/data/modname/recipes
